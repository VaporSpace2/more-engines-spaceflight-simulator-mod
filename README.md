# more-engines-spaceflight-simulator-mod


A mod made for the game spaceflight simulator.
specifically to be used on the steam version of SFS (what everyone calls spaceflight simulator)


also for some reason i cant upload the unity project so you wont be able to access these parts in unity just yet!




# ------ABOUT------




the more engines mod is a general purpose mod that currently adds a wide range but small amount of parts.

total content:

BARGO engine - side mounted engine (for some reason the exterior parts on the flame for the engine dont appear and i cant find a fix as of now)
there should be gimbal on the engine but it doesnt appear visually (flame nor engine turn but gimbal is still there) uses vanilla liquid fuel

VALKYRIE engine - large nuclear thermal engine that runs off of hydrogen, however is too large for vanilla separators to attach to and requires some thinking outside the box to use.

MONO engine - tiny low thrust and isp engine that uses monopropellant AKA hydrazine

hydrazine RCS - a normal RCS block that runs off of monopropellant AKA hydrazine, has more power than normal rcs

hydrazine fuel tank - holds some hydrazine (i cant get the fuel to display in tons, only mass_units which is the same thing as normal tons)

hydrogen fuel tank - holds some hydrogen (i cant get the fuel to display in tons, only mass_units which is the same thing as normal tons)


# PLANNED FEATURES IN ORDER


BARGO capsule - holds 1 or 2 tons of hydrazine and has bargo engines mounted on the sides that use hydrazine, capsule is to be larger than a normal capsule

special landing legs - literally just landing legs, maybe new shepard style

cargo farings - could open up in multiple different ways (petal, one side, space shuttle style)

mirror cell fission engine - extremely high ISP engine (in the thousands) that could use fissile material as fuel

jet engines - only usable in atmospheres and has 10 tons of thrust or more with maybe up to 12000 ISP and would use jet fuel




# ------HOW TO INSTALL------




to use this file, download the zip (not the source code but the zip with the name including the name of the platform you intend to use) 
in the any release you feel like using

then unzip the file, the mod file itself should be an unspecified type or .txt (i think it can be .txt)
put this file into the PARTS folder of spaceflight simulator
this can be found in
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spaceflight Simulator\Spaceflight Simulator Game\Spaceflight Simulator_Data\Custom Assets\Parts

# CONSIDER EVERYTHING BELOW USELESS WHEN THE OFFICIAL MODLOADER IS RELEASED

lastly, and i cannot stress this enough, YOU NEED TO BE IN THE MODLOADER BETA OF SFS ON STEAM (you can no longer acquire new beta access keys 
and you must ask around for them)
